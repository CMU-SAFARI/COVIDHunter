## Instructions
To reproduce the exact same results for the Switzerland case study please follow these six steps:

1. Install Xcode, [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2. Add New Swift Project (File -> New -> Project -> macOS -> Command Line Tool)
3. Copy the content of COVIDHunter/src/COVIDHunter.swift to main.swift
5. Change the default settings in main.swift based on each configuration file provided in this directory: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/COVIDHunter/tree/main/Reproduce-Switzerland-Case-Study-Results
6. Run the project

Each configuration file's name represents the configurations we used to generate each plot as follows:

| WithoutCTC_50% | This plot represents the effect of excluding environmental changes from the COVIDHunter model, by setting Ce(t)=1 in Equation 1, which leads to an inaccurate evaluation of the mitigation measures. For example, during the summer of 2020 (between the two major waves of 2020), COVIDHunter (WithoutCTC_50%) evaluates the mitigation coefficient to be as high as 0.6. This means that the mitigation measures (only mandatory of wearing mask on public transport) applied during the summer of 2020 are only 14% more relaxed compared to the mitigation measures (e.g., closure of schools, restaurants, and borders, ban on small and large events) applied during the first wave, which is implausible. This highlights the importance of considering the effect of external environmental changes on simulating the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, environmental change effects are not considered by any of the IBZ, LSHTM, ICL, and IHME models, which we believe is a serious shortcoming of these prior models. |
