As a case study, we statistically analyze the relationship between temperature and number of COVID-19 cases in Switzerland. 
We find that for each 1 degree Celsius rise in daytime temperature, there is a 3.67% decrease in the daily number of confirmed cases. 
We demonstrate how considering the effect of environmental changes on the COVID-19 spread improves the simulation accuracy.
