# COVIDHunter ðŸ¦ :construction:: An Accurate, Flexible, and Environment-Aware Open-Source COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model
A COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures (i.e., non-pharmaceutical intervention) that are applied to a region and provides insight into what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be and for how long it should be applied, while considering the potential effect of environmental conditions. Our model accurately forecasts the numbers of infected and hospitalized patients, and deaths for a given day. Described by Alser et al. (preliminary version at ...).

##  <a name="idea"></a>The key idea 
The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by calculating the daily reproduction number, R, of COVID-19 and scaling the reproduction number based on changes in both mitigation measures and environmental conditions. The R number describes how a pathogen spreads in a particular population by quantifying the average number of new infections caused by each infected person at a given point in time. The R number changes during the course of the pandemic due to the change in the ability of a pathogen to establish an infection during a season and mitigation measures that lead to the scarcity of susceptible individuals.

##  <a name="results"></a>Benefits of COVIDHunter 
To our knowledge, there is currently no model capable of accurately monitoring the current epidemiological situation and predicting future scenarios while considering a reasonably low number of parameters and accounting for the effects of environmental conditions. In this work, we develop such a COVID-19 outbreak simulation model, COVIDHunter.
COVIDHunter accurately forecasts for a given day 1) the reproduction number, 2) the number of infected people, 3) the number of hospitalized people, 4) the number of deaths, and 5) number of individuals at each stage of the COVID-19 infection.
COVIDHunter evaluates the effect of different current and future mitigation measures on the five numbers forecasted by COVIDHunter.
We release the source code of the COVIDHunter implementation and show how to flexibly configure our model for any scenario and easily extend it for different measures and conditions than we account for.
