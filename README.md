# COVIDHunter ðŸ¦ :construction:: An Accurate, Flexible, and Environment-Aware Open-Source COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model
A COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures (i.e., non-pharmaceutical intervention) that are applied to a region and provides insight into what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be and for how long it should be applied, while considering the potential effect of environmental conditions. Our model accurately forecasts the numbers of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for a given day. Described by Alser et al. (preliminary version at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251265v1).

##  <a name="idea"></a>The Key Idea 
The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by calculating the daily reproduction number, R, of COVID-19 and scaling the reproduction number based on changes in both mitigation measures and environmental conditions. The R number describes how a pathogen spreads in a particular population by quantifying the average number of new infections caused by each infected person at a given point in time. The R number changes during the course of the pandemic due to the change in the ability of a pathogen to establish an infection during a season and mitigation measures that lead to the scarcity of susceptible individuals.

##  <a name="results"></a>Benefits of COVIDHunter 
To our knowledge, there is currently no model capable of accurately monitoring the current epidemiological situation and predicting future scenarios while considering a reasonably low number of parameters and accounting for the effects of environmental conditions. In this work, we develop such a COVID-19 outbreak simulation model, COVIDHunter. COVIDHunter accurately forecasts for a given day:

1. The reproduction number, R. 
2. The number of infected persons.
3. The number of hospitalized persons. 
4. The number of deaths.
5. The number of individuals at each stage of the COVID-19 infection (healthy, infected, contagious, and immune).
6. The strength and the duration of each mitigation measure.

COVIDHunter evaluates the effect of different current and future mitigation measures on the five numbers forecasted by COVIDHunter.
We release the source code of the COVIDHunter implementation and show how to flexibly configure our model for any scenario and easily extend it for different measures and conditions than we account for.

	abstract = {Motivation: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID- 19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50\% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.
